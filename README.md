<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the example locally, you will need the basic Rust setup. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

### Build & run locally

1. Install trunk (bundler tool) using `cargo install --locked trunk`. If you are running on M1 Mac you will also have to `cargo install --locked wasm-bindgen-cli` too. More info can be found [here](https://trunkrs.dev/)
2. Install dependencies using `cargo update`
3. Start local server using `trunk serve`

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Contributing

Any contributions are **greatly appreciated**. App was made partly as a Rust excersize, so if the `clone`-ing seems too much my power level is currently not 9k.
